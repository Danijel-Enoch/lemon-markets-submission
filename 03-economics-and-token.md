# 03. Economics and Token

## Protocol Economics

Lemonloopa operates on a simple and transparent fee structure designed to generate sustainable revenue while keeping trading costs predictable for users. All fees are collected in ETH and routed directly to the Lemonloopa treasury during the current beta phase.

**Fee Structure:**
* Base fee: 0.05% per position
* Leverage fee: 0.05% per leverage unit (e.g., 2x leverage = 0.1% total fee in beta)
* Minimum trade size: 0.01 ETH

This structure ensures that fees scale proportionally with risk and position size, creating a sustainable revenue model that grows with platform usage. 

## Token Role

Lemonloopa is currently token-free during the beta phase, focusing on product development and user acquisition without the complexity of token mechanics. However, a native token launch is planned to introduce:

**Governance Rights:** Token holders will vote on protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, fee structures, and new feature implementations, ensuring decentralized decision-making as the platform matures.

**Fee Revenue Sharing:** Token holders will earn a proportional share of platform trading fees, creating direct utility and value accrual tied to protocol usage and growth.

**Early User Rewards:** Active beta traders and early adopters will receive token airdrops, rewarding community members who contribute to platform development and liquidity.

## Planned Tokenomics Overview

* **Token Name:** LOOP (proposed ERC-20 governance and utility token on Zircuit)
* **Total Supply:** To be determined based on community feedback and platform metrics
* **Supply Distribution (Preliminary):**
  * Community allocation: 50% (airdrops to beta users, liquidity incentives, ecosystem growth)
  * Team allocation: 25% (vested over 4 years with 1-year cliff)
  * Treasury/Development: 20% (protocol development, partnerships, reserves)
  * Early supporters/Advisors: 5% (vested over 2 years)

* **Token Utility:**
  * Governance rights for protocol decisions
  * Fee revenue sharing from platform trading fees
  * Potential fee discounts for token holders
  * Staking rewards for protocol security and governance participation

* **Economic Incentive:** The token creates a sustainable revenue model where utility and value are directly tied to DEX usage, ensuring alignment between token holders and protocol growth while rewarding early community members who contribute to platform development. Built on Zircuit's efficient infrastructure for optimal token performance.
