# Roadmap and Budget

## Current Development State

Lemon Markets has launched as the world's first permissionless peer-to-peer perpetual DEX on Zircuit, enabling traders to long or short any ERC-20 token without listings, liquidity providers, or gatekeepers. The core P2P architecture is operational with automatic market creation, on-chain position storage, synthetic leverage generation, and liquidation bot monitoring. The platform successfully processes real trader-to-trader settlements with isolated market liquidity and virtual liquidity seeding capabilities. Early adopters are already profiting from shorting previously untradeable assets.

## Tasks for Successful Launch

* **P2P Liquidity Optimization:** Enhance virtual liquidity seeding algorithms and opposing position matching to ensure consistent settlement efficiency across all ERC-20 markets.
* **Advanced Market Lifecycle:** Implement sophisticated market creation triggers, liquidity migration between dead/alive tokens, and automated market health monitoring.
* **Liquidation Decentralization:** Transition liquidation bot system to decentralized keeper network with incentivized community participation.
* **Enhanced P2P Features:** Develop advanced order types, position sharing mechanisms, and social trading features that leverage the peer-to-peer architecture.
* **LEMON Token Launch:** Deploy governance token with fee distribution, liquidity incentives, and community-driven parameter control.
* **Ecosystem Expansion:** Integrate with token discovery platforms, trading communities, and memecoin ecosystems to capture maximum permissionless trading demand.

## Anticipated Timeline

We anticipate a 6-month development timeline from grant approval to full P2P perpetual DEX maturity:

* **Month 1-2:** Optimize virtual liquidity algorithms, implement advanced P2P matching, and enhance market lifecycle management
* **Month 3-4:** Launch decentralized liquidation keeper network, implement social trading features, and begin comprehensive security audits
* **Month 5-6:** Deploy LEMON token with governance and fee distribution, scale to support thousands of simultaneous ERC-20 markets
* **Ongoing:** Community-driven development, ecosystem partnerships, and expansion to capture all permissionless trading demand
