# Roadmap and Budget

## Current Development State

Lemonloopa is currently operating in live beta on Solana mainnet with core functionality fully implemented and tested. The platform successfully handles real user positions with 2x leverage cap, featuring all four core smart contract instructions (Initialize Position, DEX Modify, User Modify, Process PnL). The web client built with vanilla JavaScript and Solana web3.js is live and functional, with an active user base testing the platform. The oracle system is operational, providing real-time price feeds for position management and liquidations.

## Tasks for Successful Launch

* **Platform Scaling:** Increase leverage capabilities from current 2x to 10x, then progressively to 100x as liquidity and user base grow.
* **Security Hardening:** Complete comprehensive smart contract audits and progressively open-source the codebase for community review and transparency.
* **Oracle Decentralization:** Transition from current centralized oracle to a decentralized price feed system to eliminate single points of failure.
* **Advanced Features:** Implement additional trading tools such as stop-loss orders, take-profit mechanisms, and portfolio management features.
* **Token Launch:** Deploy the LOOP governance token with fee-sharing mechanisms and distribute airdrops to early beta users.
* **Ecosystem Integration:** Develop APIs and partnerships with portfolio trackers, trading bots, and other Solana DeFi protocols.

## Anticipated Timeline

We anticipate a 6-month development timeline from grant approval to full platform maturity:

* **Month 1-2:** Scale leverage to 10x, implement advanced trading features, and begin security audit process
* **Month 3-4:** Complete smart contract audits, begin open-sourcing process, and implement oracle decentralization
* **Month 5-6:** Launch LOOP token, distribute airdrops, implement governance features, and achieve 100x leverage capability
* **Ongoing:** Continuous platform optimization, ecosystem partnerships, and community growth initiatives
