# 01. Project Description

## **Goal and Problem Solved**

Lemonloopa is a decentralized leveraged trading platform built on Solana that enables leveraged trading on any Fungible SPL-Token, including pre-launch and experimental tokens from platforms like pump.fun. The platform addresses critical gaps in the current DeFi ecosystem where centralized exchanges force users to entrust funds to third parties, facing constant risks of shutdowns, liquidity crises, hacks, and opaque operations. Meanwhile, existing decentralized exchanges either lack advanced tools like leverage or burden traders with confusing fee structures. Most importantly, many Solana tokens—especially memecoins—never reach the stage where centralized platforms provide LONG/SHORT derivatives, often requiring massive listing fees before derivative trading becomes possible.

## **Closest Competitor**

The closest competitors are centralized leveraged trading platforms like Binance Futures and decentralized perpetual protocols like dYdX or GMX. However, centralized platforms require custody of user funds and lack transparency, while existing decentralized perpetual protocols are primarily focused on major tokens and often have complex fee structures that discourage trading activity.

## **Unique Differentiators**

* **Any SPL-Token Support:** Unlike competitors focused on major tokens, Lemonloopa enables leveraged trading on any Fungible SPL-Token, including pre-launch and experimental tokens from platforms like pump.fun, opening derivative trading to the entire Solana ecosystem.

* **True Decentralization with Custody:** All positions are secured using Solana Program Derived Accounts (PDAs) with smart contracts automatically executing trading logic. Users retain custody of their funds until settlement, eliminating counterparty risk.

* **Simple Fee Structure:** Transparent and predictable fees with a base fee of 0.05% per position and leverage fee of 0.05% per leverage unit, avoiding the complex and confusing fee structures that plague other platforms.

* **Scalable Leverage:** Currently operating at 2x leverage in beta with plans to scale up to 100x leverage as liquidity expands, providing flexibility for both conservative and aggressive trading strategies.

* **Solana Performance:** Built on Solana's high-speed, low-cost network, enabling efficient leveraged trading without the high gas fees and slow confirmation times of Ethereum-based competitors.

Lemonloopa stands uniquely positioned to democratize leveraged trading across the entire Solana token ecosystem, providing institutional-grade tools with full decentralization and transparency.
