# Uniswap V2

## Track

- [x] Super App 
- [ ] Ecosystem Builder 

## Executive Description

Uniswap V2 is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables automated, trustless, and censorship-resistant trading of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It solves the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities inherent in traditional centralized exchanges—such as reliance on trusted intermediaries, centralized points of failure, custodial risks, and liquidity fragmentation—by utilizing smart contracts and automated market maker (AMM) mechanisms. The primary goal of Uniswap V2 is to facilitate transparent, permissionless, and highly liquid token swaps while providing a robust infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
