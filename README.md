## Executive Description

Lemon Markets is the world's first permissionless peer-to-peer perpetual DEX built on Zircuit that enables traders to LONG or SHORT any ERC-20 token without restrictions. Born from pure frustration watching obvious market bubbles with no way to profit from the downside, Lemon Markets operates on a revolutionary principle: traders trading traders. No liquidity providers. No token listings. No gatekeepers. No permission needed.

Whether it's memecoins, xStocks, prediction markets, or RWA tokens, if it's an ERC-20, you can trade it with synthetic leverage in a true peer-to-peer environment where Longs pay Shorts and Shorts pay Longs. The platform automatically creates markets for any token, manages isolated liquidity pools, and ensures risk-limited trading where maximum loss is always capped at initial margin.
